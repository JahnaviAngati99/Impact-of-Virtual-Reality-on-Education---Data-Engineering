# Impact of Virtual Reality on Education - Data Engineering Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **Impact of Virtual Reality (VR) on Education** using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The objective is to explore how VR affects educational outcomes and build a data engineering pipeline to manage and analyze the dataset. Key steps include data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset contains multiple features related to the use of Virtual Reality in educational settings, such as:

- **Learning Outcomes**: Measures assessing how VR improves student learning.
- **Demographic Information**: Details about the students and institutions using VR.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Data on how VR influences student engagement, retention, and overall satisfaction.

## Project Structure

- **`Impact of Virtual Reality on Education - Data Engineering.ipynb`**: This notebook includes all data processing steps, transformations, and analysis. It walks through data loading, cleaning, and visualization of key insights.
  

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Data Transformation**: Creating new features and metrics to enhance the analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating trends and patterns in the dataset to gain insights into VR's impact on education.
- **Data Visualization**: Generating graphs and plots to support data interpretation.
- **Pipeline Creation**: Building a scalable data pipeline for processing the VR education dataset.
